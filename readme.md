<h1 align="center">THE DART GAME</h1>
This is a two player dart game that is very entertaining  to play.
There are 24 quadrants. Each spot on the dart field has different points. The closest you are to the center; the more points will be generated. 
There are 3 rounds to the game. The player with the most wins, wins the game.
To shoot your dart, you must click on the playersâ€™ names.
The first player to reach 500 points wins the round.
There is a reset button to reset the game. 
There is an alert that states who won each round.


This is a link to a website that inspires me to do this game https://thedartsgame.sourceforge.net/ 


I also took some element from the game Mortal Kombat 1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBGpEXbPhms

In addition, I also added a snippet of well known music from the popular game, Sonic the Hedgehog.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gsa_4s3CjmI to add some flair to this game. 

I really enjoyed making this game. I learned a lot from the challenges I encountered along the way. Through it all, I am happy to bring out my vision of making this game to fruition.
