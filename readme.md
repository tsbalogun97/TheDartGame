<h1 align="center">THE DART GAME</h1>
This is a two player dart game that is very entertaining  to play.
There are 24 quadrants. Each spot on the dart field has different points. The closest you are to the center; the more points will be generated. 
There are 3 rounds to the game. The player with the most wins, wins the game.
To shoot your dart, you must click on the players’ names.
The first player to reach 500 points wins the round.
There is a reset button to reset the game. 
There is an alert that states who won each round.

This is a link to a website that inspires me to do this game https://thedartsgame.sourceforge.net/ 


I also took some element from the game Mortal Kombat 1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBGpEXbPhms

In addition, I also added a snippet of well known music from the popular game, Sonic the Hedgehog in order to add some flair to the game. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gsa_4s3CjmI  

I really enjoyed making this game. I learned a lot from the challenges I encountered along the way. Through it all, I am happy to bring out my vision of making this game to fruition.
